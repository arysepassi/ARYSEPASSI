### My History with Coding ###
</center>  

Sometimes I joke that I should have gone into software engineering in college, because I enjoy coding so much. I am *very much* a novice in programming, and the extent of my knowledge is currently limited to simple functions and scripts. But, I do learn new things everyday. I *mostly* code in R, followed by SQL, STATA, and finally, SAS. The thing I like about coding is that it allows me to be self-sufficient with my research, and it's not a hard skill to learn. It does have a bit of a learning curve, but by no means do you need to be in a classroom to master the basics. Again, *fortune favors the bold*. Be bold, and try to learn some coding on your own! 

In the future, I'd like to write some tutorials like my colleague, [Mark Bounthavong](https://mbounthavong.com/programming), has done that might be useful for other people coding in R. For now, I'm working on expanding my GitHub repository with coding I've used for previous projects.
